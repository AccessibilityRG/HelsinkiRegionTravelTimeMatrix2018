# Origin-Destination data 

Origin-destination data used for PT and walking calculations with MetropAccess-Reititin. The OD-data represents the centroids of the 250m grid cells (their coordinates). All rows have a unique ID that can be used to merge the data with the [grid](data/MetropAccess_YKR_grid.geojson).

 - Origins are divided into subsets (idenfified with running number 1-294 on the name of the file).
 - All destination locations
