# Documentation about testing etc. 


Test points for reititin were selected mostly along the metro line. Three points per station were set, one on the right side, one on the left and one on top of the station to see that the connections are working as they should. The rest of the points are located in the housing disticts in Espoo, Helsinki and Vantaa.
